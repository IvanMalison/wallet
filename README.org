#+TITLE: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Tokens

If you have Nix installed, you can use =nix-shell= to enter a shell where
=keysmith=, =quill= and =dfx= are available. Be sure to do this before turning off
all communications (wifi, bluetooth and Ethernet) if you are using the same
machine to run air-gapped commands.

However, do be aware that your machine may have spyware on it, there have even
been reported cases of stealthy code that monitors the clipboard, and swaps
out things it recognizes as crypto addresses with its own addresses.

* Creating a self-custody account

#+begin_src sh
# On air-gapped machine:
keysmith generate -o seed.txt
keysmith private-key -o private.pem
keysmith account -i 0

ACCOUNT=<account displayed above>

# On connected machine:
# Transfer tokens to the $ACCOUNT. Note that this is usually done at Coinbase
# or your exchange. I don't give a command here, but I can't presume where
# your non-self-custodied tokens might becoming from, and I don't want to
# offer a command that isn't appropriate for your circumstances.

# Confirm the transfer by checking the account balance:
dfx ledger --network=https://ic0.app balance $ACCOUNT
#+end_src

* Checking the balance of an account

#+begin_src sh
dfx ledger --network=https://ic0.app balance $ACCOUNT
#+end_src

* Using quill to stake and manage neurons

#+begin_src sh
AMOUNT=100000 # Amount of tokens to be staked

# On air-gapped machine:
quill --pem-file private.pem neuron-stake \
    --amount $AMOUNT --name 1 > ~/dl/stake.txt
# On connected machine:
quill send ~/dl/stake.txt

NEURON=<neuron-id from the last output, without underscores>
DELAY=252460800    # 8 years; halve this for 4 years

# On air-gapped machine:
quill --pem-file private.pem neuron-manage $NEURON \
    --additional-dissolve-delay-seconds $DELAY > ~/dl/lock.txt
# On connected machine:
quill send ~/dl/lock.txt

PRINCIPAL=<Principal Id shown in the Neuron tab of the NNS App>

# On air-gapped machine:
quill --pem-file private.pem neuron-manage $NEURON \
    --add-hot-key $PRINCIPAL > ~/dl/add-hot-key.txt
# On connected machine:
quill send ~/dl/add-hot-key.txt
#+end_src
